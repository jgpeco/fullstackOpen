# fullStackOpen - University of Helsinki

This repo will be used to store my notes, examples and exercises of the fullStackOpen course that I'm attending, the course is taught by the computer science staff of the University of Helsinki, it is a free-to-attend course, however, to get a certificate with the university you must be a citizen of Finlad.

My plan is to finish parts 1 to 5 of the course (in those parts we will learn about React, NodeJS, MongoDB and the main reason why I'm attending the course: testing the applications with Jest, Supertest, react-testing-library and Cypress)

A brief introduction to what the course will provide, according to the university itself:

> This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.'

\*_DISCLAIMER_: The content of this repo may be used for reference while doing the exercises of the course. Please do not copy and paste my exercises' resolutiojns, your answers will probably not be accepted by the university and you will not learn how to code this way. The best way to learn how to code is coding =)
